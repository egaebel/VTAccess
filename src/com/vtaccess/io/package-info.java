/**
 * This package provides classes for inputting and outputting objects and strings in a pre-formatted way.
 * ScheduleIO, provides the user with methods to save and load Schedules, and Schedule Lists, and a List of
 * Final Exams in a standardized way. SecureIO provides a semi-secure facility to write usernames
 * and passwords to file. (This is really only good enough to provide protection from on site 
 * username & password theft (where someone opens the file and reads it); it will not stand
 * up to any attempts to crack it, and should not be used in situations where a system is
 * particularly vulnerable to attacks).
